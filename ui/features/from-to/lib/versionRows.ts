/**
 * @file features/from-to/lib/versionRows.ts
 *
 * Turns a raw `$from_to` response into the version list the UI reads.
 *
 * Two things the response does not guarantee on its own:
 *
 * **Rows can repeat.** Reading a child collection through its parent duplicates
 * every row once per parent version. Measured against a local istSOS4:
 * `GET /Things(1)/Datastreams?$from_to=1970-01-01T00:00:00Z/2099-01-01T00:00:00Z`
 * answers ten rows for five datastreams — ids 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,21,21 — because
 * the nested path joins against `Thing_traveltime` and Thing 1 has two
 * versions. `$count=true` on that same request is *correct* (5), since counting
 * is over distinct `(id, systemTimeValidity)` pairs, so counts and rows
 * disagree. The duplicates are identical, so collapsing on that same pair
 * restores the right answer. See `entityPath.ts` for the other half of the fix.
 *
 * **Order is the API's, not a guarantee.** Rows arrive ordered by
 * `(id, systemTimeValidity ASC)`, but the timeline depends on it, so it is
 * re-established here rather than taken on trust.
 *
 * Rows whose validity cannot be read are dropped — see `parseValidity`.

 * identical validity strings. Measured against a local istSOS4 — 120 rapid
 * edits to one Thing came back as 120 rows carrying only **four** distinct
 * validity strings, 76 of them sharing `06:29:00Z/06:29:00Z`. Keying on
 * validity alone therefore discarded real versions, which is the opposite of
 * what this function is for.
 *
 * Each version carries its own commit, and those stay distinct (120 rows, 120
 * commit ids), so the commit is what separates versions the printed timestamp
 * cannot. A genuine duplicate from a nested path repeats the same row, commit
 * included, so it still collapses.
 *
 * A row with no commit falls back to validity alone — the same behaviour as
 * before, which is the best available when `$expand=Commit` was not asked for.
