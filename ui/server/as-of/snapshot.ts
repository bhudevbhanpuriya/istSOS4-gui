/**
 * @file server/as-of/snapshot.ts
 *
 * Builds Things exactly as they stood at one instant of transaction time. The
 * map (every Thing) and the datastream panel (one Thing) both go through
 * `readThingsAsOf`, so the two can never disagree about a snapshot.
 *
 * A single `Things?$as_of=…&$expand=Datastreams(…),Locations` looks like it
 * would do, and it is what the panel used to send. It is wrong in two ways:
 *
 *  - The backend applies `$as_of` to TOP-LEVEL expands only. Anything nested
 *    (`Datastreams($expand=Observations(…))`) is joined against the live
 *    tables, so the "latest reading" was the latest reading *now*. Datastreams
 *    are therefore read as their own collection, which makes Observations,
 *    Network, Sensor and ObservedProperty top-level expands of it.
 *
 *  - `Thing_Location` is not a versioned table. Relocating a Thing rewrites
 *    its link row in place, so `$expand=Locations` joins the snapshot Thing to
 *    its CURRENT Location. Where a Thing stood is instead read from its
 *    HistoricalLocations — versioned, and written on every relocation.
 *
 * HistoricalLocation `time` is not compared with the snapshot instant: it is
 * client-settable and is a different clock (the seeded rows carry times weeks
 * before their Things existed). Which rows existed at the instant is decided
 * by `$as_of` itself; `time` only orders the rows that did.
